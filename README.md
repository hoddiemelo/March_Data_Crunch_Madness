Introduction

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Basketball Tournament is informally referred to as "March Madness". With 68 college basketball teams competing in a single-elimination tournament, March Madness is played every spring in the US to determine the national championship of the major college basketball teams. Based on Kaggleâ€™s Machine Learning Mania(https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018#evaluation ), competitors of 2018 Deloitte March Data Crunch Madness predict the probability that a team wins any given game in the 2018 Tournament. Logloss is used as evaluation. Extensive historical data to jump-start the modeling process is gived. Competitors are encouraged to incorporate their own sources of data.

Highlights of Our Project

One of the highlight of our project is the new variables, including EFG-OEFG, TPP-DTPP, SRS, SOS, Adj_win and the most important one Coach Influence. Another one is our project's philosophy, let the marchine learning algorithm decide variables and models. We try to make all procedures become rational and sentific.
